# Roundtable

**Your AI dev squad, around one table.**

Describe what to build — then *watch* a persistent squad of AI agents plan it,
implement it in parallel, review it, and ship it. Every file, diff, preview,
and decision stays on the table.

## Why Roundtable?

Most multi-agent tools are a black box: a prompt goes in, a wall of text comes
out, and everything in between is invisible. Roundtable makes the run itself
the product:

- 👀 **See the work, not just the output.** Agents sit around a live table.
  Handoffs, review states, artifacts, and chat happen in front of you.
- 🧭 **Plans you can trust.** A planner turns your request into a
  dependency-aware task graph — you see what runs in parallel and what waits.
- 🧾 **Nothing gets lost.** Files, diffs, live previews, review comments, and
  fixer rounds stay attached to the conversation, forever replayable.
- 🔁 **Quality is a gate, not a hope.** Reviewers block bad work; failed tasks
  get bounded fixer rounds instead of infinite loops.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Persistent agent squad** — planner, implementers, reviewer, architect, and
  fixer roles that stay with your workbench across missions.
- **Visual roundtable** — live runs, handoffs, artifacts, review state, and
  chat in one view, plus breakout side rooms.
- **Dependency-aware scheduler** — independent tasks run in parallel waves;
  blocked tasks wait for exactly what they need.
- **Bounded review → fix loop** — failed reviews or blocking safety findings
  trigger capped fixer rounds (`ROUNDTABLE_MAX_FIX_ROUNDS`).
- **Built-in safety scan** — agent artifacts are checked for secrets and
  dangerous code before they land.
- **Pluggable agent runtimes** — deterministic local dispatch for CI, real
  CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode), E2B sandboxes, or MiniMax models.
- **Storage that grows with you** — local JSON for prototypes, normalized
  Postgres for shared production runs.
- **One action layer** — the same business workflows power the Next.js app,
  REST routes, tRPC, and the CLI.

## 🎬 See it in action

<div align="center">

*A live mission: architecture sketch on the shared board, implementers working
in parallel, a reviewer waiting at the gate.*

*The plan and its artifacts: parallel tasks, versioned files, author-tinted
diffs, and live previews — all attached to the run.*

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdwinjJ1/roundtable.git
cd roundtable
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start a mission. If
the port is busy, Next.js prints the alternate URL.

Useful checks:

```bash
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm cli workflow smoke --message "Build a waitlist page"
```

> **Zero-key demo:** the default `local-dispatch` adapter is deterministic and
> needs no API keys — perfect for trying the workbench, CI, and the golden-path
> demo before wiring up a real agent runtime.

## ⚙️ How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["🧑 You<br/>describe a goal"] --> P["📋 Planner<br/>task graph with dependencies"]
    P --> S{"⚡ Scheduler<br/>parallel waves"}
    S --> A["🔨 Atlas<br/>implements T1"]
    S --> B["🔨 Beam<br/>implements T2"]
    A --> R["🔍 Vera<br/>review gate"]
    B --> R
    R -- pass --> OK["🚢 Ship<br/>files · diffs · previews"]
    R -- fail --> F["🛠️ Fixer<br/>bounded fix rounds"]
    F --> S
```

1. You describe a goal in plain language.
2. The planner turns it into a dependency-aware task plan.
3. The scheduler runs every unlocked task in parallel waves.
4. Agents produce files, diffs, previews, review comments, and handoffs.
5. Safety or review failures create bounded fixer rounds.
6. The run finishes with artifacts and decisions preserved in the workbench.

## 🔌 Agent adapters

`local-dispatch` is the default deterministic adapter for development and CI.
Swap in a real runtime when you want real work:

| `ROUNDTABLE_AGENT_ADAPTER` | Behavior | Requires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `local-dispatch` *(default)* | Deterministic template output; used by devrt/CI. | — |
| `agent-cli` / `claude-cli` / `opencode` | Spawns the selected local CLI runtime (`claude-code`, `codex`, `opencode`, router, or custom command) in the workspace. Runtime status reports command path, detected version, and credential source before execution. | `ROUNDTABLE_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_AGENT=1`; CLI login or API key |
| `e2b` | Runs the agent CLI inside an E2B sandbox. Falls back to `local-dispatch` (logged) if the key is missing. | `E2B_API_KEY` |
| `minimax` | Runs each agent against the real MiniMax chat model (M3/M2.7). Strips `<think>` reasoning; falls back to `local-dispatch` if the key is missing. | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` |

## 🔧 Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust as needed. The defaults run
entirely locally with zero keys.

<details>
<summary><b>Storage — local JSON or Postgres</b></summary>

Roundtable stores data in `.roundtable/data.json` by default. Set
`DATABASE_URL` to use Postgres. When a database URL is present, the production
default is the normalized driver:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://roundtable:roundtable@localhost:5432/roundtable \
ROUNDTABLE_STORE_DRIVER=postgres_normalized \
corepack pnpm dev
```

For a local Docker-backed database:

```bash
corepack pnpm db:up
corepack pnpm db:migrate:local
corepack pnpm db:smoke:local
corepack pnpm dev:postgres
```

To migrate existing local JSON data into Postgres:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://roundtable:roundtable@localhost:5432/roundtable \
corepack pnpm migrate:postgres
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Auth — Google OAuth via NextAuth</b></summary>

Roundtable uses NextAuth. Production sign-in should use Google OAuth with a
verified Google email. The credentials provider is a local developer fallback.

Required production values:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
```

Authorized Google redirect URIs:

- `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Workspaces & safety</b></summary>

Production workbenches default to
`ROUNDTABLE_WORKSPACE_ROOT/{ownerId}/{workbenchId}`. Custom workspace paths
are ignored in production unless `ROUNDTABLE_ALLOW_CUSTOM_WORKSPACE_PATH=1`
is set deliberately.

The safety scan of agent artifacts (secrets + dangerous code) is on by
default; set `ROUNDTABLE_SAFETY_ENABLED=false` only for testing.
