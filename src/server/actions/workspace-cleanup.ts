   workspace-cleanup.ts — delete a run's workspace when its session is deleted.

   Two kinds of workspace exist:
   - Managed: created by us under ROUNDTABLE_WORKSPACE_ROOT — safe to remove
     entirely.
   - Workbench-linked: the user's REAL project directory. Deleting a session
     must never destroy their project, so outside the managed root we only
     remove our own output subtree (.roundtable/runs).

   Removal is best-effort: a missing directory or FS error must not block the
   session deletion itself.
